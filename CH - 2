~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.1 Network Security Threats Landscape

  > Custom malware
  > Multiple bad actors
  > Infrastructure Attack
  > Many do not understand malware
  > Loss of control
  > Denial of service
  > Undetected communication

Motivations

  > Financial
  > Other several reasons
  > Geopolitical 
  
Corporate Challenges

  > Large networks
  > Open Software
  > Virtualization  
  > Cloud Computing
  > IoT/IoE

2.2 Distributed Denial Of Service [DDoS]

  > To consume all the bandwith and resources 
  
General Categories of DDoS Attacks

  > Direct || The attacker generates packets that are send directly to the victim
  
  > Reflected || UDP often used due to the lack of THREE-WAY HANDSHAKE 
              || Unknow participants send the packets to the victim
              
  > Amplification || Unknow participants send larger packet to the victim
              
2.3 Social Engineeringt Methods
  
  > Is the art of manipulation people so they give up confidential information
  
Tactics
  
  > Phishing || Appears to come from a legimate source 
             || Fake Emails or web sites that apper legitimate || bank web media
  
  
  > Malvertising || Malicious ADS in legitimate webs sites 
                 
  > Phone scams || Call conversations
  
DEFENSES 

  > Education
  > Passwod Management
  > Two-Factor Authentication
  > Antivirus 
  > Management
  > Information Classification || CIA
