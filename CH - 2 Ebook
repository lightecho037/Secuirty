CH - 2 Understanding Security Threats

Hacktivists || Those how hack not for personal gain 
            || Political Reasons
            
Thrill Hackers || Do it for the notoriety

CLASSIFYING ATTACK VECTORS 

Theats agents can be brouped into the following Five categories

  > Human || Malicious and nonmalicious insiders and outsiders
          || Terrorist
          || Spies
          || Terminated Personel
          
  > Natural || Floods 
            || Fires  
            || Hurricans .....etc...
            
  > Technical || Hardware 
              || Software
              || code
              || New tecknology
              
  > Physical || Perimeter 
             || Biometric
           
  > Operational || Process
                || Procedure
                || CIA
                
SPOOFING
  Appears to come from a trusted source
  > IP Address || Simmulate a legitimate ip address to pass ACL and firewalls
  > MAC Address || Same as IP Address
  > Email || It is possible to alter the fields of From, Return, Path, Reply 
  
PASSWORD ATTACKS
  > Dictionary Attacks
  > Brute Force Attacks [Refer to > Exhaustive attack]
 
RECONNAISSANCE ATTACKS

  > Reconnaissance Attacks [Refer to > Fingerprinting]
  > The way informaiton can be gather 
  Example 
  > Ping Scan || Nmap || ScanLine || SuperScan

PORT SCAN

  > NMAP || The most popular port  scan tool use today 
         || This tool perform scans with certain flags set in the SCAN PACKETS 
         || Security Analyst and [hackerr] can make certain assumptions based on the responses received 
         
  THE CHACKER CAN CRACK PACKETS ON THE TCP HEADER FLAGS
  
  * URG || Urgen pointer field significant
  * ACK || Acknowledgment field significant
  * PSH || Push Function
  * RST || Reset the connection
  * SYN || Synchronize sequence numbers
  * FIN || No more data from sender
  
  * NULL scan || This test sometimes penetrate firewalls and edge routers 
              || because sequence number of 0 and no flags 

  * No reponse || The port is open o the target
  
  * RST || The port is closed on the target
  
  * XMAS || Sets the FIN, PSH, AND URG flags, when the packet is sent
  
  * Example:
  
            -]# nmap -sX 192.168.232.129
            
OS FINGERPRINTING 

  > It is a method that is used to determine the Operating System 

BUFFER OVERFLOW

  > It is the amount of data that is submitted to a data and is larger than the buffer can handle due to poorly  OS or App
  > To prevent || Install Updates || check overflow conditions || 
  > The key to preventing many buffer overflow attacks is input VALIDATON 
  
DOS

  > Popular attacks inlcude SYN floods, pings of death, smurf attacks

DDoS

  > Is carried out from multiple attack locations 
  > Infected Devices are called || Zombies || Software in use are BOTNETS           
  > BONETS || Help to HIDE the original source of the attack 
 
  > Attacks can be
            * Direct ||  > Attacker > Handler > Zombies > VICTIM
            * reflected || Smurf attack >> send ICMP 
            * Amplified || similar to Direct 

PING OF DEATH

  > Oversized ICMP packet is sent to the target. MAXIMUM allowable IP packet size is 65,535 including packet header

MAN - IN - THE - MIDDLE - ATTACK

  > The Attacker listens to the communication between two comminicators and changes the contents of this communication 
  
ARP POISONING
  
  > The attacker answers the ARP request from other computer then both computers will have the attackers MAC add 
  > Dynamic ARP Inspection [DAI] || Use by cisco to mitigate Arp Poisoning
  > DHCP Snooping || Use by cisco to mitigate Arp Poisoning

SOCIAL ENGINEERING 

  >  The art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information

  * PHISHING // PHARMING 
  
    > Learn personal information || Credit cards, financail data 
    > Common methods || Fake website 
    > SPEAR PHISHING || Conduct to a dedicated target 
    > PHARMING || Similar to phishing || Reroutes DNS to alternate Website
